# Project Go - User Management (CRUD) API

A simple User Management RESTful API built with Go, Gin framework, and PostgreSQL.
This project demonstrates how to build a modular and scalable backend with key features such as:

- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- File upload functionality
- PostgreSQL integration using pgx
- API documentation using Swagger (with annotations)
- Redis caching for improved performance on selected endpoints

Designed for clarity, maintainability, and as a solid foundation for more advanced applications.
